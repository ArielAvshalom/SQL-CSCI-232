Save all of the code in a .txt or .sql file and submit it here.
It is an exercise in getting our feet wet in SQL

1: Create the following tables:
A table employee with columns called id, name, title
 id is an integer and title is a varchar.
 Example tuple: 666, arnold benedict, super-visor

A table called mage with columns called id, type, powerLevel, schoolOfMind
 Id and powerLevel is an integer, name, type and schoolOfMind is a varchar.
 Example tuple: 666, dark, 9999, chaotic-evil

A table called muggle with columns called id, mindSet, discernibility
 Id is an integer,  mindSet is a varchar and discernibility is a float
 Example tuple: 69, open, .78

 2: For the tables above insert these tuples (all values given on one line, figure out how to put it into the tables)
id            name           title                         type            powerLevel         schoolOfMind       mindSet      discernibility

432         Mordo         evil henchman        dark             67676                 chaotic-evil
666         benedict     super-visor             sub-dark      9001                   neutral-evil

2              guppy          local fish                                                                                                                                .01

3: do the following commands
a: update the table mages with a new row called belief with type varchar
b: update belief on tuple with id 666 on table mage with the value dogmatic
c: delete the row with id 2 on the table muggle
d:  delete the row with id 3 on the table muggle
e: delete the table muggle
